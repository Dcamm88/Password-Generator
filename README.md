# Password-Generator

I modified the premade javascript from what I've learned in week 3 to get the password generator to work and generate randomized characters that are no lower than 8 and no greater than 128 characters into the box containing mixed Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers, and Special Characters that was provided.

Also I managed to code in window prompts and alerts asking a series of questions such as 'How many characters would I like to us' etc...

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
